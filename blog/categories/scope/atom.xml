    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>```ruby</p>

<p>class Invitation &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :expired, where("invitations.expired_at &lt; ?", DateTime.now)
end</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>It looks nothing wrong with the above code at the first glance. Let's have an interesting experiment,</p>

<p><code>bash
1.9.3p327 :001 &gt; Invitation.expired.to_sql
 =&gt; "SELECT `invitations`.* FROM `invitations`  WHERE (invitations.created_at &lt; '2013-06-29 12:00:16')"
1.9.3p327 :002 &gt; DateTime.now.utc
 =&gt; Sat, 29 Jun 2013 12:35:50 +0000
</code></p>

<p>As you can see, the <code>DateTime.now.utc</code> returns "12:35:50", while the SQL statement in the first line says "12:00:16", there's a mysterious gap between two of them. Actually, the "12:00:16" is the time I started the rails console, to be more precise, it's the time the <code>app/models/invitation.rb</code> is loaded, it's the time the <code>DateTime.now</code> in the <code>expired</code> scope was evaluated. This could be a serious problem for some of you, espeically under production environment, since once you deployed your application, the <code>DateTime.now</code> will keep what it was when the application was fully loaded by the application server, and it will be a constant value instead of a variable value as you imagined, the only chance it will get changed is the next time you deploy the application.</p>

<p>The problem seems to be mysterious, but the solution to the problem is pretty straightforwarding, <code>lambda</code>, have <code>lambda</code> work with the scope will make the statements in the closure evaluated dynamically every time the scope is called.</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<p>class Invitation &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :expired, lambda {</p>

<pre><code>where("invitations.expired_at &lt; ?", DateTime.now)
</code></pre>

<p>  }
end</p>

<p>```</p>

<p><code>bash
1.9.3p327 :001 &gt; Invitation.expired.to_sql
 =&gt; "SELECT `invitations`.* FROM `invitations`  WHERE (invitations.created_at &lt; '2013-06-29 12:40:11')"
1.9.3p327 :002 &gt; DateTime.now.utc
 =&gt; Sat, 29 Jun 2013 12:40:12 +0000
</code></p>

<p>It seems to be working this time. It's time to add more spec to cover this.</p>

<p>```ruby
describe Invitation do
  descirbe '.expired' do</p>

<pre><code>it "should find all the expired invitations" do
  invitation_1 = Factory(:invitation, :expired_at =&gt; DateTime.now - 1.seconds)
  invitation_2 = Factory(:invitation, :expired_at =&gt; DateTime.now + 1.seconds)

  Invitation.expired.to_a.should == [invitation_1]
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>The above test will fail if you not using <code>lambda</code>, just keep in mind, test will save your ass every time.</p>
