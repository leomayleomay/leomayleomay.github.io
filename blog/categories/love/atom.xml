<p>2009, we got married, for the past 12 years, we take care of each other, we fight, sometimes we went too far to say the word "divorce", we were too young.</p>

<p>2013, our angel baby girl came to this world, that's the best thing I've had in my life, I can not forget the night when you are going to deliver, you woke me up gently and calmed me down. The moment you were sent into the delivery room, I had a lot in my mind, it was a rainy night, a peaceful night. When our baby was out, and you were sent to the ward, I can still remember the blood all over you, I can not help myself, you are a hero mom, to me and to our baby.</p>
