You may have run into the same situation with me, given a Chinese character, you want to find out the corresponding [Chinese Telegraph Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_telegraph_code), there're tons of utility tools online for that, but the thing is you want to do it on the server side, here's a gem I am going to present to you: [ctc](https://github.com/leomayleomay/ctc), check it out and convert the Kanjie to CTC and vice versa like a boss, :)
